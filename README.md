# My customized command-line environment

This folder contains every modification I made to feel myself comfortable in a new machine.

It customizes vim with carlhuda/janus, zsh with robbyrussel/oh-my-zsh and then adds my own dotfiles to them and to my new home directory.

### installation

I don't recommend to use the install script, because this will be messing up your home folder.

    curl -Lo- https://github.com/kaze/command-line/blob/master/install.sh | bash;
