# My customized command-line environment

This folder contains every modification I made to feel myself comfortable in a new machine.

It customizes vim with carlhuda/janus, zsh with robbyrussel/oh-my-zsh and then adds my own dotfiles to them and to my new home directory.

### installation

curl -Lo- http://codebase.kaze.hu/command-line/raw/7413ffb7c2c2/install.sh | bash;
